# Baremetal-Install-Multiple-Servers
This Repository contains Cisco Intersight Workflows to Install ESXi, Windows Server and RHEL over multiple UCS X Series Blades at once on local disks. May also work for other UCS Standalone or IMM Servers but hasn't been tested at the moment. 

This workflow will import:

- Baremetal Install Multiple Hosts (Workflow)
- Deploy Windows Server on Local Virtual Disk (Workflow)
- Deploy ESXi Host on Local Virtual Drive (Workflow)
- Deploy RHEL Host on Local Virtual Disk (Workflow)
- Get Virtual Drives from Server (Workflow)
- Baremetal Install from JSON (Workflow)
- ESXi Baremetal Install Hosts (Custom Data Type)
- Windows Server Baremetal Install Hosts (Custom Data Type)
- RHEL Baremetal Install Hosts (Custom Data Type)

## Work in Progress...

### Prerequisites

- A known working Cisco UCS Server Template to derive Server Profiles for each blade.
- M2 RAID controllers on each blade with a minimum of

### Import

### Configuration

### Known Issues

- The workflows will NOT activate the server profiles if there are policies changes that require a second reboot. If the storage policy is creating the virtual drive for the first time, you may want to first activate a working server profile to create the virtual disks before exeecuting the workflow. Workaround: deploy derived server profiles before running the workflow the first time

- Workflows will fail if there are already server profiles with the same name or if one of the blades already have a profile attached. Workaround: Unassign profile from servers or modify the workflows to on√≤y perform the operating system install
